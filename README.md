MacroManager
============

A macro manager for windows (GKT# support comming soon). Lets you record macros and replay them.

# Why?
Originaly I wanted something "quick and dirty" to ease my Diablo 2: Lord of Desctruction playing without actually running a bot.
Instead of finding a commecrialy available solution I decided to build my own. 

I have since stopped playing and focus mainly on programming this on my spare time...

# How?
.Net and WinForms because it was supposed to be quick and dirty. I am planning to build a GTK# interface and port everyting to Mono since I am mainly a Linux user. 

# Build?!
Clone the repo and build it in VS 2013 (I use Express Desktop, any flavour should do).
